Developer Test III: React Application
Problem Description
Optimetriks conducts a lot of retail audits about various products. To do this, Optimetriks deploys agents to go out to the different retailers in the field, interview them then fill out a questionnaire on the Smala mobile application. However, in the past year Optimetriks has grown significantly and sometimes has little to no time to go into new cities and put together a workforce of field agents to collect the data. For that reason, Optimetriks is exploring way an alternative method of collecting the same data via Google Street View.

Your Task
You are required to build a web application prototype using React and Google Street View whereby a user is able to navigate various streets and browse shops, dukas, stores, etc., pick up coordinates of a store, then fill out a small questionnaire on the side. Below is an image of how the page could look like.
